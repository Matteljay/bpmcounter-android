BPM-Counter is a very simple app for manually tapping any type of beat count.
From your heart rate to difficult to batch analyse music, rotations of a machine (RPM) you can record anything.
To increase accuracy, set the tap-count to a high value and make sure you do not skip any beats.
The tap-count is a persistent setting that you can change on the top-right corner of the app.
The minimum input value for the number of taps is 2 of course. Only then can a time-delta be calculated.
If you quick-tap the console text box the app will be reset and ready for the next measurement
