BPM-Counter is a very simple app for manually tapping any type of beat count.
From your heart rate to difficult to batch analyze music, rotations of a machine (RPM) you can record anything.
To increase accuracy, set the tap-count to a high value and make sure you do not skip any beats.
The tap-count is a persistent setting that you can change on the top-right corner of the app.
The minimum input value for the number of taps is 2, only then can a time-delta be calculated.
When recording the measurement, the number on the button will decrease and the color will turn from green to red.
When the number and color reset, active recording ended and the value is printed in the console.
If you quick-tap the console text box the app will be reset and ready for the next measurement.
